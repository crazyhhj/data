["\n     CLOSE ON JOKER (30's), tears in his eyes from laughing so\n     hard. He's trying to get it under control. His greasy, black\n     hair is matted down. He's wearing an old, faded red hooded\n     zip-up sweatshirt, a threadbare gray scarf, thin from years\n     of use, hangs loosely around his neck.\n \n     WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his\n     mouth. Almost forming a smile.\n \n     He's sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50's),\n     African American. Her office is cramped and run-down in a\n     cramped and run-down building. Stacks of folders piled high\n     in front of her.\n \n     She just sits behind her desk, waiting for his laughing fit\n     to end, she's been through this before. Finally it subsides.\n \n     Joker takes a deep breath, pauses to see if it's over.\n \n     Beat.\n \n                         JOKER\n               --is it just me, or is it getting\n               crazier out there?\n \n     Despite the laughter, there's real pain in his eyes.\n     Something broken in him.

Looking\n               for work. The garbage strike seems\n               like it's been going on forever.\n               These are tough times.\n                   (then)\n               How 'bout you. How's the job? Still\n               enjoying it?\n \n                           JOKER\n               Yeah, I   mean, it's different each\n               day, so   I really like that.

Writes something down.

Pulls out a weathered\n notebook. Slides it across to her--\n \n                     JOKER\n           I've been using it as a journal,\n           but also a joke diary. Funny\n           thoughts or, or observations-- Did\n           I tell you I'm pursuing a career in\n           stand-up comedy?\n \n She's half-listening as she flips through his journal.\n \n                     SOCIAL WORKER\n           No. You didn't.\n \n                     JOKER\n           I think I did.\n                                                             3.\n \n \n She doesn't respond, keeps flipping through his journal--\n \n                     SOCIAL WORKER\n           Oh yeah. Because of what your\n           mother said,-- about your purpose.\n           \"To bring laughter and joy to the\n           world,\" right?\n \n                     JOKER\n           Right.\n \n ANGLE ON JOURNAL, pages and pages of notes, all in neat,\n angry-looking handwriting. Also, cut out photos from hardcore\n pornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings.\n \n A flash of anger crosses Joker's face. We see him picking at\n his right eyebrow, almost obsessively. Trying to stay calm.\n His eyebrow is actually half-gone. Something he does a lot.\n \n                     JOKER\n           I didn't realize you wanted to read\n           it.\n \n The social worker gives him a look, then reads something in\n the pages that gives her pause.\n \n                     SOCIAL WORKER\n               (reading out loud)\n           \"I just hope my death makes more\n           sense than my life.\"\n \n She looks up at Joker. He just stares back. Lets it hang out\n there for a beat.\n \n Then he laughs a little, even though he doesn't think it's\n funny--\n \n                     JOKER\n           Yeah. I mean, that's just--\n \n                     SOCIAL WORKER\n           Does my reading it upset you?\n \n He leans in.\n \n                     JOKER\n           No. I just,-- some of it's\n           personal. You know?\n \n                     SOCIAL WORKER\n           I understand. I just want to make\n           sure you're keeping up with it.\n \n She slides his journal back to him. He holds it in his lap.\n                                                          4.\n \n \n                     SOCIAL WORKER\n           What about your mom?

She really needs me.\n \n                     SOCIAL WORKER\n           Seems like she's been sick a lot\n           since you got home.\n \n                      JOKER\n               (nods)\n           Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I\n           was in the hospital, after my last\n           episode-- she was having trouble\n           getting over there to visit.\n \n She looks back up at the clock, she needs to get to her next\n appointment.\n \n                     SOCIAL WORKER\n           All right. So, I'll see you again,\n           two weeks from today?\n \n He nods. But keeps sitting there for a moment.\n \n She stands up, trying to signal it's time for him to leave--\n \n                     SOCIAL WORKER\n           Is there something else I can help\n           you with, Arthur? My next\n           appointment is waiting.\n \n He just keeps sitting there.\n \n                     JOKER\n           Yeah, I was wondering if you could\n           ask the doctor to increase the\n           dosage on my medications? Nothing\n           seems to make a difference.\n \n                      SOCIAL WORKER\n               (looking over his record)\n           Do you know which ones you'd like\n           increased?\n \n Shakes his head, no.\n \n                     SOCIAL WORKER\n           Have you been sleeping?\n                                                               5.\n \n \n                         JOKER\n                   (lying)\n               Some.\n \n     She glances at his file again.\n \n                         SOCIAL WORKER\n               Arthur, you're on seven different\n               medications. Surely they must be\n               doing something.\n \n     He finally stands up. Zips up his faded red sweatshirt.\n \n     Looks at her--\n \n                         JOKER\n               I just don't wanna feel so bad\n               anymore.\n \n                                                   CUT TO BLACK:\n \n     TITLE:\n \n                                 JOKER\n \n \n", "\n     GOTHAM SQUARE IS CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC. Non-stop honking\n     horns, pedestrians crowding the sidewalk. Huge billboards,\n     giant movie marquees, garbage bags piled high everywhere.\n     Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something\n     bouncy and fast-paced.\n \n     FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET, we see Joker. He's dressed\n     as a sad-faced HOBO CLOWN. This is his job.\n \n     Dressed in tattered clothes, dark five o'clock shadow painted\n     on his face, big bulbous red nose, his mouth's outlined in\n     white, turned down at the corners.\n \n     He's holding up a sign in front of Kenny's Music Shop that\n     reads, \"EVERYTHING MUST GO!\" A banner above the store reads,\n     \"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!\" Behind him, an OLD MAN plays a piano\n     on the street. Both of them there to draw attention to the\n     big sale going on in the store.\n \n     Joker's doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the\n     music. Most people walk right past, ignoring him. A few bump\n     into him by mistake.\n \n     JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS, no more than 15-years-old,\n     walking toward him. He moves out of their way. They crack up\n     laughing when they see him. Start making fun of him.\n                                                                 6.\n \n \n     Joker ignores them, tries to do his job the best he can while\n     maintaining some dignity.

Joker doesn't say anything. Just bends over\n     to pick up the sign--\n \n     Another kid kicks him in the ass--\n \n                         KID #2\n               Whoops.\n \n     Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk. Oddly, the old man\n     playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--\n \n     The kids crack up. One of the boys grabs Joker's sign and\n     takes off running across the street--\n \n     The other kids follow, weaving through traffic--\n \n     Joker gets up and gives chase. He needs his sign back.\n \n     He almost gets hit by a taxi, spinning out of the way just in\n     time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short\n     of hitting him.\n \n     Joker keeps running through traffic. People stare. A clown\n     barreling down the street has got to be a joke--\n \n \n", "\n     The five boys are booking it down the crowded street laughing\n     and whooping it up.

Out of nowhere Joker gets hit in the face!\n \n     He falls to the ground.\n \n     One of the kids was hiding between parked cars and hit Joker\n     with the \"EVERYTHING MUST GO!\" sign, splintering it in two--\n                                                                 7.\n \n \n     The other kids turn back and walk up to Joker down on the\n     ground.\n \n     Joker reaches out, still trying to save the sign--\n \n     THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Joker.\n     It's brutal and vicious. Nobody on the street stops to help.\n \n     CLOSE ON JOKER'S HOBO CLOWN FACE, down on the ground. Sweat\n     running down his face, smearing his make-up. He doesn't even\n     look like he's in pain.

Some white grease-\n     paint still smudged on the sides of his face.\n \n     He finds an empty seat in the back of the bus. Sees a sad-\n     eyed FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL, face puffy from crying, sitting on\n     her knees looking back at him. Her mother's facing forward,\n     but even from behind you can tell she's angry.\n \n     Joker sees the sad-eyed girl staring straight back at him. He\n     doesn't know where to look, feeling self-conscious and small.\n     He gets back into \"character\" smiling like a clown and covers\n     his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-a-boo game\n     with her.\n \n     The girl stares back at him for a moment then giggles--\n \n                          WOMAN ON BUS\n                    (turns back to Joker;\n                     already annoyed)\n               Can you please stop bothering my\n               kid?\n \n                         JOKER\n               I wasn't bothering her, I was--\n \n                          WOMAN ON BUS\n                   (interrupts)\n               Just stop.\n \n     AND SUDDENLY JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH. LOUD. He covers his mouth\n     trying to hide it-- Shakes his head, laughter pausing for a\n     moment, but then it comes on stronger. His eyes are sad. It\n     actually looks like the laughter causes him pain.\n                                                                                    8.\n \n \n     People on the bus are staring.

He\n     reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small card. Hands it to\n     the woman.\n \n     CLOSE ON THE CARD, it reads: \"Forgive my laughter. I have a\n     condition (more on back)\"\n \n     She turns the card over and there is a bunch of information\n     in small writing--\n     \"It's a medical condition causing sudden, frequent, uncontrollable laughter that\n     doesn't match how you feel. It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain\n     neurological conditions.\"\n \n     She doesn't read it (but if you freeze frame the movie you\n     could). She just shakes her head annoyed and throws the card\n     on the ground.\n \n     Joker laughs harder. Tears running down his face.\n \n     Not wanting to attract any more attention to himself, he\n     pulls up his red hood, and uses his threadbare scarf to cover\n     his mouth, trying to muffle the laughter.\n \n     He looks out at the city passing him by.\n \n \n", "\n     The bus pulls away, sun almost gone.\n \n     Joker heads slowly down the litter-covered streets.

Now before\n                 he comes out, I just want to say\n                 that we're all heartbroken here and\n                 sensitive to what's going on in the\n                 city tonight.

Doesn't hear his introduction or see a STAGEHAND pull\n open the curtain for him to go out--\n \n ON SET, THE CURTAIN'S OPEN, Don Ellis and his Jazz Orchestra\n are playing Joker on. He doesn't come out. Murray looks over\n to the empty space in the curtain.\n \n The audience laughs.\n \n BEHIND THE CURTAIN, Joker sees the stagehand motioning for\n him to go out on stage. Joker starts out, pausing when he\n takes a step into the bright lights. The stagehand doesn't\n see him stop, and drops the curtain back on Joker before the\n audience can really see his face--\n \n Tangling Joker up in the curtain.\n \n The audience keeps laughing thinking it's part of his act.\n The band keeps playing him on. Joker untangles himself from\n the curtain and the audience gets a good look at him.\n \n Some continue laughing. A few boo. Most don't know what to\n make of him.\n \n Joker walks across the stage, forgetting to wave like he\n practiced. He trips over the riser surrounding the set when\n he goes to shake Murray's hand. Almost falls on him.\n \n Murray tries not to crack up. The audience laughs. Thinks\n it's part of Joker's act.\n \n Joker reaches out to hug Dr. Sally as she goes in for a\n handshake. Another awkward moment. More laughs.\n \n Joker finally sits down next to Murray. Crosses and uncrosses\n his legs. Can't get comfortable.\n \n                     MURRAY FRANKLIN\n           So, ahhh, thanks for coming on the\n           show.

Looks\n through it to find a new joke.\n \n                     MURRAY FRANKLIN\n           You brought a joke book?\n \n The audience laughs.
